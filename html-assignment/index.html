        <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Javier Pachano! I'm passionate about helping my community and making a positive impact on the lives of those around me. Family is at the heart of everything I do, and I love spending time with my loved ones, always striving to support and take care of them.</p>

    <p>I'm also an aspiring designer, driven by creativity and innovation. I'm working hard to hone my skills and bring my ideas to life. One of my biggest dreams is to build a life in Canada, where I hope to combine my passion for <abbr title="User Experience/User Interface Designer">UX/UI</abbr> design with my desire to contribute to a supportive and thriving community.</p>
